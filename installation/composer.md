## Install the Dependencies via Composer
Dependencies are handled using the [Composer package manager](http://getcomposer.org/).

##### If you don't have composer installed globally

	cd your-folder
	curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install

##### For global composer installations

	cd your-folder
	composer install
