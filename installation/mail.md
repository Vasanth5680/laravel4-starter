## Setup Mail Settings

Setup your mail settings by  opening and updating `app/config/mail.php`.

This will be used to send emails to your users, when they register and they request a password reset.

While testing locally, you can set `'pretend' => true,` in `app/config/mail.php` to simulate email being sent.
