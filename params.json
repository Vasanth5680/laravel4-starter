{"name":"Laravel4-starter","tagline":"Starter site to get you up and running with Laravel 4 and Bootstrap 3 with built-in authentication and user admin","body":"## Laravel 4 Bootstrap Starter Site\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snipe/laravel4-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snipe/laravel4-starter)\r\n\r\nThis is a Laravel 4 Starter Site and it will help you getting started with Laravel 4.\r\nIt's based off the great [Laravel Starter Kit](https://github.com/brunogaspar/laravel4-starter-kit)\r\nfrom [brunogaspar](https://github.com/brunogaspar), with some additional refinements,\r\nbugfixes and a cleaner, more modern UX.\r\n\r\nIt includes examples on how to use the framework itself and how to use some\r\npackages, like the awesome [Sentry 2](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry) package.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Included goodies\r\n\r\n* Twitter Bootstrap 3.1.1\r\n* jQuery 1.10.2\r\n* Custom CLI Installer\r\n* Translation-ready with internationalization files\r\n* Custom Error Pages:\r\n\t* 403 for forbidden page access\r\n\t* 404 for not found pages\r\n\t* 500 for internal server errors\r\n\t* 503 for the maintenance page\r\n* Back-end\r\n\t* User and Group management\r\n\t* Manage blog posts and comments\r\n\t* Login brute-force prevention via [Sentry 2](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry) - default lockout is 5 failed login attempts\r\n* Front-end\r\n\t* User login, registration, activation and forgot password\r\n\t* User account area\r\n\t* Blog functionality with comments\r\n\t* Contact us page\r\n* Packages included:\r\n\t* [Cartalyst Sentry 2 - Authentication and Authorization package](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- PHP 5.3.7 or later\r\n- MCrypt PHP Extension\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## How to Install\r\n\r\n### 1) Downloading\r\n#### 1.1) Clone the Repository\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/snipe/laravel4-starter your-folder\r\n\r\n#### 1.2) Download the Repository\r\n\r\n\thttps://github.com/snipe/laravel4-starter/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 2) Install the Dependencies via Composer\r\n##### 2.1) If you don't have composer installed globally\r\n\r\n\tcd your-folder\r\n\tcurl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\r\n\tphp composer.phar install\r\n\r\n##### 2.2) For globally composer installations\r\n\r\n\tcd your-folder\r\n\tcomposer install\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 3) Setup Database\r\n\r\nNow that you have the Starter Kit cloned and all the dependencies installed, you need to create a database and update the file `app/config/database.php`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 4) Setup Mail Settings\r\n\r\nSetup your mail settings by  opening and updating `app/config/mail.php`.\r\n\r\nThis will be used to send emails to your users, when they register and they request a password reset.\r\n\r\nWhile testing locally, you can set `'pretend' => true,` in `app/config/mail.php` to simulate email being sent.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 5) Use custom CLI Installer Command\r\n\r\nNow, you need to create yourself a user and finish the installation.\r\n\r\nUse the following command to create your default user, user groups and run all the necessary migrations automatically.\r\n\r\n\tphp artisan app:install\r\n\r\n(Note that [the Travis CI file](https://github.com/snipe/laravel4-starter/blob/master/.travis.yml) skips this step and instead calls the individual setup methods and just inserts the example user, since [the CI build](https://travis-ci.org/snipe/laravel4-starter.svg?branch=master) isn't interactive.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 6) Accessing the Administration\r\n\r\nTo access the administration page, you just need to access `http://your-host/admin` in your browser and it\r\nwill redirect you to the login page.\r\n\r\nAfter being authenticated, you will be redirected back to the administration page.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 7) Brute-force Lockout Settings\r\n\r\nThe default Sentry setting is to lockout the user for 15 minutes after 5 failed login attempts. To\r\nchange these settings, edit your `/vendor/cartalyst/sentry/src/config/config.php` file locally.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### 8) Contact\r\nIf you have questions about this project, you can reach me at snipe@snipe.net, or on Twitter at [@snipeyhead](https://twitter.com/snipeyhead).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### LICENSE\r\n\r\n> Version 1, December 2009\r\n\r\n> Copyright (C) 2009 Philip Sturgeon <email@philsturgeon.co.uk>\r\n\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\r\n copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\r\n as the name is changed.\r\n\r\n> DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n 1.
