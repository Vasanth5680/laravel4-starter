## Laravel 4 Bootstrap 3 Starter Site

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snipe/laravel4-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snipe/laravel4-starter)

This is a Laravel 4 Starter Site and it will help you getting started with Laravel 4.
It's based off the great [Laravel Starter Kit](https://github.com/brunogaspar/laravel4-starter-kit)
from [brunogaspar](https://github.com/brunogaspar), with some __additional refinements__,
__bugfixes__, __more secure defaults__ and a __cleaner, more modern UX__ using Bootstrap 3.
