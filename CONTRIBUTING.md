# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome! Bear in mind that this project is intended to be a starter site only, not a true blogging platform, so we don't want to add too many features that could complicate someone getting started with their own CRUD app.

When submitting pull requests, make sure you've made your changes to a new branch you've created. This makes managing pull requests much easier for the maintainer and will result in your pull request being reviewed more quickly.

Please submit all issues and pull requests to the [snipe/laravel4-starter](https://github.com/snipe/laravel4-starter) repository!

Please submit issues and pull requests for the Laravel framework itself (not specific to this sample application) should be made on the [laravel/framework](http://github.com/laravel/framework) repository.
